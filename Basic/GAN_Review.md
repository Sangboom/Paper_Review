# Summary

### In 3~5 sentences, describe the key ideas, experiments, and significance

Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) is a type of unsupervised learning that learns by creating and competing generators and discriminators. Generator is a model to learn the data distribution of training data. Discriminator is a model that discriminates whether a data sample is a sample of training data or a sample generated by a generator. Therefore, the generator can generate a data sample similar to the training data sample.

# Strengths

### What are the strengths of the paper? Clearly explain why these aspects of the paper are valuable

The reason why this paper is important is that it is first time to learn two networks through adversarial relationship. The V(D, G) in this paper converges to 0 when the discriminator distinguish the actual training data and the fake data generated by the generator. However, when generator performance increases, discriminator cannot distinguish fake data because fake data is very similar to actual training data. Therefore, the value of V (D, G) becomes negatively divergence. Therefore, you can learn the generator through this. Due to this, it is possible to generate samples with the generator's distribution even if the probabilistic model is not clearly defined, and there is no need to assume a specific model.

# Weaknesses

### What are the weaknesses of the paper? Clearly explain why these aspects of the paper are weak. Please make the comments very concrete based on facts (e.g. list relevant citations if you feel the ideas are not novel)

GAN is an innovative algorithm, but there are limitations. GANs cannot generate high resolution images and there is no clear standard for when to stop learning. Also, it is difficult to learn because it is a minmax optimization problem.

# Why accepted

### If the paper has been accepted, why do you think its accepted?

Previous attempts have been made to create generators. However, this is the first time have attempted to learn the generator by using a Discriminator, and it was successful. Thus, I think the paper was accepted.
